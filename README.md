# frawolf.dev

Production build made with Svelte for my personal website and portfolio.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

In this production build I use Netlify adapter, to automatically deploy the website on Netlify when I push a commit.

```bash
npm run build
```
